landing Page project on The Odin Project
The aim of the landing page challenge is to recreate a webpage provided by The Odin Project.
The webpage consists of 5 sections, 1 in the footer and 4 in the body.
The sections are identified by classes with div elements within them.
The styles for the classes include placing them in flex boxes with different colored backgrounds for each.
